    // What commitment do we make to our speakers?

This support is provided through a series of facilitated workshops, as well as one-on-one coaching sessions.

    // What commitment is expected from speakers?
    // We are flexible and accommodating, but we do expect a high level of commitment from speakers. If you cannot commit to these requirements, we reserve the right to exclude you from the final speaker line-up.
