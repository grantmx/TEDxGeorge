                            Ideas know no boundariesâ€”they are not confined by geography, religion, politics, or culture. TEDxGeorge believes that ideas belong to everyone, regardless of skin-color, gender, identity, or social class. With a global perspective, we seek to source diverse ideas and ensure they are accessible to all. We know that powerful ideas, when shared with care, have the potential to unite different groups and build a collective vision for a better future.

                        <p>Our talks are the beginning, not the conclusion, of discussions. TEDxGeorge values skepticism and the role it plays in refining ideas, revealing their strengths and areas for improvement. We encourage conversations after our talks as a way to gain clarity and explore how these ideas can be applied. Our commitment is to provide an open and respectful environment where vigorous debate can thrive. We reject bigotry and hate speech, instead promoting constructive conversations as a means to bridge gaps and build understanding.</p>
                        <p>By adhering to these guiding principles, TEDxGeorge remains true to TED's ethos, creating a platform where ideas can inspire, challenge, and drive positive change within our community.</p>
