                            Talks must remain nonpartisan and secular. Content advocating for political ideologies, activism, or religious doctrines will not be accepted.</li>

                            Speakers must present credible, evidence-based ideas. Talks containing unverified claims, conspiracy theories, or misleading science will be rejected.</li>
